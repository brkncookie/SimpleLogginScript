# A simple script to log the deletion process of files

This is my first time creating a repository for a project and i did want to put something simple

Those scripts are inspired by ```Wicked Cool Shell Scripts 101 Scripts for Linux, OS X, and UNIX Systems``` by Dave Taylor, Brandon Perry
## Purpose
The purpose of this simple shell script is to log the deletion process of files in the simplest way possible
plus backing-up the deleted files  and along with that there is a little script called ```unrm```
to get back the deleted files
## Pre-requisites
you'll first need the ```logger``` utility That is to send logs to the syslog daemon.
I tested this script with Rsyslog and it will also work with other logging systems that use syslog protocol
and you may need to adjust your system logging configurations because this script uses the ```user.notice``` severity/priority

what i needed to configure is as follow :
```
$ echo "user.notice   /var/log/del.log" >> /etc/rsyslog.conf
```
## Usage
I use this script as a wrapper , instead of calling ```rm``` ,
i call this script and let it log the events, back the file(s) up and  then the script itself call ```rm``` to remove the file(s).
